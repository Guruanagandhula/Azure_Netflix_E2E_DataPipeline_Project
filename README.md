Project Description
This project focuses on building a comprehensive, end-to-end Azure Data Engineering solution that seamlessly integrates streaming and batch data ingestion, transformation, and analytics. It follows the principles of the Medallion Architecture, ensuring a structured and scalable approach to data processing. By implementing this architecture, the solution facilitates an efficient and organized data flow, transitioning from raw ingestion to progressively refined and enriched datasets. These optimized datasets will ultimately support real-time and batch analytics, enabling stakeholders to derive meaningful insights and make data-driven decisions with confidence.
